A classic TIC TAC TOE game 

https://ewelina-borucka.github.io/tic-tac-toe

I created this game in week three of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course (WDI-18 Sydney). 
It was my first game built with JS.
The timeframe for the project was 4 days. 

For this project I used:
* Javascript / jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
